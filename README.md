# Grocery-Budget-Project
Dynamic webpage, built using React, that helps the user accurately predict what the grocery bill will be before leaving the house in order to avoid going over-budget

# The user is presented with a list of possible grocery items that, when checked, update the total at the bottom. When the total is exceeded, some type of warning will appear. I plan to add buttons to sort grocery items by category, and possibly a search function. 

# The user will have the option to set fields for budget and sales tax for food and non-food items.
